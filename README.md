# MM-DOS-A-Novel-Dataset-Of-Workout-Activities
This dataset includes exercises performed by volunteers, recorded from two different positions: side view and front view. Additionally, the exercises are filmed using a thermal camera and tracked with four IMU sensors placed on different parts of the trainee's body. The sensor positions are as follows:

1. Right upper arm
2. Left upper arm
3. Right thigh
4. Left thigh

The IMU sensors capture acceleration in three dimensions for each training session.

The dataset is organized as follows:

*Part 1:*

*Exercises included in this part:*
1. Engine
2. Jumping Jacks
3. Jump
4. Sit-up

This part contains a file for each trainee. Each file includes four subfiles corresponding to the four exercises. Each subfile contains three videos: two videos from the two different views and one thermal camera video. Additionally, each subfile includes the IMU sensor data.
